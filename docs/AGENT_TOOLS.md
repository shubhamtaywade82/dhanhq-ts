# Agent Tools and MCP

The SDK exposes itself to LLM clients through a tool registry and an MCP
server. This document covers what exists, how permissions work, and how to add
a tool.

## Permission model

Two independent gates guard every call.

**Scope.** A `Policy` holds a set of scopes. Read tools need only the scope
they declare.

| Scope | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| `portfolio:read` | profile, funds, holdings, positions |
| `market:read` | instruments, quotes, option chains, charts, technicals |
| `orders:read` | orders, trades, order preview, margin requirement |
| `orders:write` | placing and modifying orders |
| `orders:cancel` | cancelling orders |
| `alerts:write` | conditional triggers |
| `risk:write` | kill switch and P&L exit controls |

Scopes come from `DHANHQ_AGENT_SCOPES` (comma or space separated), defaulting
to the three read scopes when unset.

**Live-trading gate.** Any tool whose risk level ends in `write` additionally
requires *both* `DHANHQ_MCP_ENABLE_WRITES=true` and `LIVE_TRADING=true`. Holding
`orders:write` is not enough on its own — an agent handed full scopes still
cannot trade until an operator opens the gate.

## Risk levels

| Level | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `read_only` | No account state read or changed beyond public market data |
| `trade_adjacent_read` | Reads that inform trading (preview, margin, structures) |
| `live_write` | Places or modifies real orders |
| `destructive_write` | Cancels orders or exits positions |

## Tools

**Portfolio** — `dhan_profile`, `dhan_funds`, `dhan_holdings`,
`dhan_positions`, `dhan_orders`, `dhan_trades`

**Market data** — `dhan_search_instruments`, `dhan_ltp`, `dhan_ohlc`,
`dhan_quote`, `dhan_option_chain`, `dhan_option_expiries`,
`dhan_historical_data`, `dhan_intraday_data`

**Analysis** — `dhan_technical_analysis`, `dhan_market_bias`,
`dhan_margin_requirement`

**Orders** — `dhan_order_preview`, `dhan_place_order`, `dhan_modify_order`,
`dhan_cancel_order`

**Skills** — one `dhan_skill_<name>` per registered skill, gated by the risk
and scope the skill itself declares.

`dhan_place_order` refuses any order whose instrument cannot be resolved from
the scrip master. That is deliberate: without instrument metadata the
surveillance, product-support and permission checks cannot run at all, so the
order would go out unchecked.

## MCP server

`dhanhq-mcp` speaks JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio and supports protocol versions
`2025-06-18` and `2024-11-05`.

Methods: `initialize`, `ping`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`, `resources/list`,
`resources/read`, `prompts/list`, `prompts/get`.

Resources: `dhanhq://account/{profile,funds,holdings,positions,orders}` and
`dhanhq://market/capabilities`.

Prompts: `system_prompt`, `portfolio_summary`, `market_analysis`,
`risk_report`, `order_preview`.

Tool failures are reported in-band as `isError` with the message as text
content, rather than as JSON-RPC errors — the model needs to see why a call was
refused in order to react to it. Protocol-level problems (unknown method,
invalid params) still return JSON-RPC errors.

Every tool call is bounded by `toolCallTimeoutMs` (15s by default) so a
rate-limit backoff cannot hang the client indefinitely.

## Adding a tool

1. Add an input schema to `src/agent/schemas.ts`.
2. Add an entry to the relevant group in `src/agent/catalogue.ts`, giving it a
   scope, a risk level and a handler.

Handlers contain no permission logic. Enforcement happens once, in
`AgentToolRegistry.execute`, so there is exactly one place where an agent call
can be refused.
