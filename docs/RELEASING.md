# Releasing

The package publishes as **`@shubhamtaywade82/dhanhq-ts`**.

> This is a community SDK. Dhan publishes its own official clients as
> [`dhanhq`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dhanhq) and
> [`dhanhq-ts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dhanhq-ts). Do not publish this
> package under the `@dhanhq` scope or any name implying vendor authorship.

## One-time setup

1. Create an npm **automation** access token on an account that can publish to
   the `@shubhamtaywade82` scope.
2. Add it to the repository as the `NPM_TOKEN` secret
   (*Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions*).

Nothing else is needed — the scope is a personal one, so no npm organization
has to exist.

## Cutting a release

1. Update `CHANGELOG.md`: move items out of `Unreleased` into a new version
   heading, and update the link definitions at the bottom.
2. Bump the version — this commits and tags in one step:

   ```bash
   npm version minor   # or patch / major
   ```

3. Push the commit and its tag:

   ```bash
   git push --follow-tags
   ```

4. Publish a GitHub Release for the new tag. That triggers
   `.github/workflows/publish.yml`, which runs `prepublishOnly`
   (clean → typecheck → test → build) before pushing to npm.

`workflow_dispatch` on the same workflow can publish manually, including under
a non-`latest` dist-tag for prereleases.

## Publishing from a laptop

Possible, but `package.json` sets `publishConfig.provenance: true`, which
requires a CI environment with an OIDC token. A local publish must opt out:

```bash
npm publish --no-provenance
```

Prefer the workflow — provenance is what lets consumers verify the tarball was
built from this repository at that commit.

## Pre-flight checks

CI runs these on every push, but they are worth running before tagging:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build

# Declaration resolution across node10 / node16 / bundler
npx @arethetypeswrong/cli --pack .

# Exactly what lands in the tarball
npm pack --dry-run
```

## Versioning

Semantic versioning. Note in particular:

- Renaming or removing a public method is a **major** bump. Method signatures
  are the contract for anything depending on this SDK.
- Tightening a risk-pipeline default, narrowing a policy scope, or changing
  what the live-trading gate permits is at minimum a **minor** bump and needs a
  `CHANGELOG.md` entry under **Changed**, since it can stop a caller's orders
  from going out.
- Adding a tool, skill or indicator is a **minor** bump.
