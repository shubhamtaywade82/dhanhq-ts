# DhanHQ TS — TypeScript SDK for Dhan API (v2)

Production-grade TypeScript SDK for DhanHQ APIs with **WebSocket market feed**, **order execution safety**, and **Node-first support with browser-safe read-only usage where transport limits allow**.

> **Community project.** This is an independent SDK and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by Dhan. Dhan publishes its own official clients as [`dhanhq`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dhanhq) and [`dhanhq-ts`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dhanhq-ts).

---

## Why This SDK

- Typed API generated from OpenAPI
- Real-time market data with binary WebSocket parsing
- Safe order execution with validation, `correlationId`, and no blind retries
- Built for Node.js trading systems, bots, and backend services
- Exposes both ergonomic resources and the low-level generated client
- Batteries included above the transport layer:
  - **Technical analysis** — SMA/EMA/WMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger, ATR, ADX, Stochastic, Supertrend, VWAP, OBV, plus a multi-timeframe bias engine
  - **Option analytics** — Black-Scholes pricing, Greeks, implied volatility, max pain, PCR, OI walls
  - **Risk pipeline** — pre-trade checks wired into every agent order path
  - **Skills** — eleven composable trading strategies that stop at a reviewable intent
  - **Agent tools + MCP server** — the whole SDK exposed to LLM clients behind a scope and live-trading gate

---

## Installation

```bash
npm install @shubhamtaywade82/dhanhq-ts
```

Requires Node.js 18 or newer. Ships both ESM and CommonJS builds with
TypeScript declarations for each.

Installing straight from the repository also works — the `prepare` script
builds on install:

```bash
npm install git+https://github.com/shubhamtaywade82/dhanhq-ts.git
```

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize Client

```ts
import { DhanClient } from "@shubhamtaywade82/dhanhq-ts";

const client = new DhanClient({
  token: process.env.DHAN_TOKEN!,
  clientId: process.env.DHAN_CLIENT_ID!,
});
```

---

### 2. Place Order

```ts
await client.orders.place({
  dhanClientId: process.env.DHAN_CLIENT_ID!,
  transactionType: "BUY",
  exchangeSegment: "NSE_FNO",
  productType: "INTRADAY",
  orderType: "MARKET",
  validity: "DAY",
  securityId: "12345",
  quantity: 15,
  correlationId: "strategy-entry-001",
});
```

---

### 3. Start WebSocket Market Feed

```ts
await client.ws.connect();

client.ws.market.subscribe([
  { exchangeSegment: "NSE_FNO", securityId: "12345" },
]);

client.ws.market.on("tick", (tick) => {
  console.log(tick.ltp);
});
```

---

### 4. Listen for Real-time Order Updates

```ts
client.ws.orders.on("order", (order) => {
  console.log(order.Status, order.AvgTradedPrice);
});
```

---

### 5. Market Data, Instruments and Option Chains

```ts
// Resolve a symbol to a security id (scrip master, cached in memory)
const [reliance] = await client.instruments.search("RELIANCE");

// Snapshot prices for up to 1000 instruments at once
await client.marketFeed.ltp({ NSE_EQ: [reliance.securityId] });
await client.marketFeed.quote({ IDX_I: [13] });

// Option chain, flattened into a sorted list of strikes
const chain = await client.optionChain.fetchNormalized({
  underlyingScrip: 13,
  underlyingSeg: "IDX_I",
  expiry: "2026-02-26",
});
```

---

### 6. Technical Analysis

```ts
import { TechnicalAnalysis, analyzeMultiTimeframe, rsi, latest } from "@shubhamtaywade82/dhanhq-ts";

// Indicators are pure functions over number arrays
latest(rsi([100, 102, 101, 105 /* … */], 14));

// Or compute every timeframe at once and blend them into one bias
const analysis = new TechnicalAnalysis(client.charts);
const result = await analysis.compute({
  securityId: "13",
  exchangeSegment: "IDX_I",
  instrument: "INDEX",
  intervals: [5, 15, 60],
});

analyzeMultiTimeframe(result).summary;
// { bias: "bullish", setup: "buy_on_dip", confidence: 0.81, … }
```

Every indicator returns an array the same length as its input, with `null`
where there is not yet enough data — so indicator output can be indexed by bar
without re-aligning it.

---

### 7. Option Analytics

```ts
import { greeks, impliedVolatility, maxPain, openInterestFromChain } from "@shubhamtaywade82/dhanhq-ts";

greeks({
  spot: 24_000,
  strike: 24_200,
  timeToExpiry: 10 / 365,
  riskFreeRate: 0.065,
  volatility: 0.15,
  optionType: "call",
});

maxPain(openInterestFromChain(chain));
```

---

### 8. Risk Pipeline

```ts
import { Pipeline, riskProviderFor } from "@shubhamtaywade82/dhanhq-ts";

const pipeline = new Pipeline({
  provider: riskProviderFor(client),
  limits: { maxQuantity: 50, dailyMaxLoss: 25_000 },
});

// Throws RiskViolationError on the first failure …
await pipeline.run({ args: order, instrument });

// … or collect every violation for a preview
const { passed, violations } = await pipeline.report({ args: order, instrument });
```

Checks cover trading permission, ASM/GSM restrictions, product support,
order type, quantity and notional, market hours, position count,
single-symbol concentration, daily loss, and options-specific rules. Account
checks are skipped — not failed — when no data provider is configured, so the
pipeline stays usable offline for order-shape validation.

These checks encode NSE/BSE rules and resolve instruments from the Indian
scrip master; they do not apply to non-Indian books.

---

### 9. Skills

Skills are named sequences of steps over a shared context. The structure
skills stop at an `intent` — they resolve strikes and premiums but never place
orders, leaving execution to an explicit, separately-gated call.

```ts
import { createSkillRegistry } from "@shubhamtaywade82/dhanhq-ts";

const skills = createSkillRegistry();

const { intent } = await skills.call(
  "iron_condor",
  { symbol: "NIFTY", expiry: "2026-02-26", wingWidth: 200 },
  client,
);
```

| Skill | Risk | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `buy_atm_call`, `straddle`, `strangle` | `trade_adjacent_read` | `orders:read` |
| `iron_condor`, `bull_put_spread`, `bear_call_spread` | `trade_adjacent_read` | `orders:read` |
| `covered_call`, `protective_put` | `trade_adjacent_read` | `orders:read` |
| `market_data_summarizer` | `read_only` | `market:read` |
| `square_off_all`, `square_off_position` | `destructive_write` | `orders:write` |

---

### 10. Agent Tools and MCP

Every resource, analysis helper and skill is exposed as a tool behind a
permission policy.

```ts
import { AgentToolRegistry, Policy } from "@shubhamtaywade82/dhanhq-ts";

const tools = new AgentToolRegistry({ client, policy: Policy.readOnly() });

await tools.execute("dhan_search_instruments", { query: "NIFTY" });
await tools.execute("dhan_order_preview", order); // validation + risk, places nothing
```

Two independent gates guard writes: the policy must hold the scope, **and**
both `DHANHQ_MCP_ENABLE_WRITES=true` and `LIVE_TRADING=true` must be set.
Read tools need only the scope.

Run the MCP server over stdio:

```bash
DHAN_CLIENT_ID=... DHAN_ACCESS_TOKEN=... npx dhanhq-mcp
```

Claude Desktop / MCP client configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dhanhq": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@shubhamtaywade82/dhanhq-ts", "dhanhq-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "DHAN_CLIENT_ID": "...",
        "DHAN_ACCESS_TOKEN": "...",
        "DHANHQ_AGENT_SCOPES": "portfolio:read,market:read,orders:read"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The server exposes tools, six account resources (`dhanhq://account/*`,
`dhanhq://market/capabilities`) and five prompt templates.

---

### 11. WebSocket Execution Orchestration

The WebSocket is the real-time truth source. `OrderTracker` resolves a placed
order to its fill using order-update events instead of polling
`GET /orders/{id}`, and `PositionMonitor` turns market ticks into exit signals.

```ts
import { OrderTracker, PositionMonitor } from "@shubhamtaywade82/dhanhq-ts";

const tracker = new OrderTracker();
const monitor = new PositionMonitor();

client.ws.orders.on("order", (state) => tracker.onOrderUpdate(state));
client.ws.market.on("tick", (tick) => monitor.onTick(tick));

// Register the waiter *before* placing — a fast fill can beat the HTTP response.
const correlationId = "entry-001";
const settled = tracker.waitFor(correlationId, { timeoutMs: 60_000 });
await client.orders.place({ correlationId, /* … */ });
const fill = await settled; // { status: "TRADED", filledQuantity, averagePrice }

monitor.track({
  securityId: "2885",
  exchangeSegment: "NSE_EQ",
  quantity: fill.filledQuantity,
  entryPrice: fill.averagePrice!,
  stopLoss: 1386,
  target: 1428,
  trail: { atr: 7, multiplier: 2 },
});

monitor.on("exit", async (signal) => {
  // stop_loss | target | trailing_stop
  console.log(signal.reason, signal.pnl);
});
```

`PositionMonitor` only *decides* — it never places an order, so the same
instance drives a live exit, a paper log, or an alert. It emits exactly one
exit per position, checks the stop before the target when a tick gaps through
both, and ratchets the trailing stop upward only.

Full loop in [`examples/ws-execution.ts`](examples/ws-execution.ts).

---

### 12. Account-Level Risk Controls

The pre-trade pipeline stops a bad order before it is sent. These stop the
damage after it accumulates — and they keep working when your process does not.

```ts
// Auto-square-off everything at +₹5,000 or −₹2,500
await client.traderControls.setPnlExit({
  profitValue: 5_000,
  lossValue: 2_500,
  enableKillSwitch: true,     // block re-entry once the book is flattened
  productType: ["INTRADAY"],
});
await client.traderControls.getPnlExit();
await client.traderControls.stopPnlExit();

// Emergency stop: blocks trading for the rest of the day
await client.traderControls.setKillSwitch("ACTIVATE");
```

Through the agent layer these sit on `risk:write`, deliberately separate from
`orders:write` — an agent allowed to trade cannot disarm the account's own
safety rails as a side effect.

See [`examples/risk-controls.ts`](examples/risk-controls.ts).

---

### 13. Global Stocks (US Equities)

A separate book under `/v2/globalstocks/*`: balances in USD, fractional
quantities, and no exchange segment, product type or validity on orders.

```ts
await client.globalStocks.marketStatus.isOpen();
await client.globalStocks.funds.getLimit();       // USD, not INR
await client.globalStocks.holdings.list();

// Charges + margin in one affordability decision
const { sufficient, totalMargin } = await client.globalStocks.costSummary({
  securityId: "AAPL", transactionType: "BUY", price: 190, quantity: 2,
});

await client.globalStocks.orders.place({
  transactionType: "BUY", orderType: "LIMIT",
  securityId: "AAPL", quantity: 0.5, price: 190,   // fractional shares
  targetPrice: 205, stopLossPrice: 180,
});

// AMOUNT orders spend a dollar value instead of buying a share count
await client.globalStocks.orders.place({
  transactionType: "BUY", orderType: "AMOUNT", securityId: "MSFT", amount: 100,
});
```

Kept in its own namespace so USD and INR positions never blend — an agent
asked for "my holdings" gets one book or the other, never a mix.

The domestic **risk pipeline does not apply here**: its checks resolve
instruments from the Indian scrip master and encode NSE/BSE rules. Global
Stocks writes are still gated by scope, the live-trading flag, and their own
order contract.

See [`examples/global-stocks.ts`](examples/global-stocks.ts).

## Key Concepts

### 1. Correlation ID (MANDATORY)

Every trading order should include a `correlationId` for:

- idempotency
- recovery via `/orders/external/{id}`
- traceability across order placement and execution updates

---

### 2. WebSocket is the Real-time Truth Source

- LTP should come from WebSocket, not REST polling
- execution and exit logic should react to WS events
- REST is for placement, reconciliation, and history

---

### 3. No Blind Retries

Order placement is **never auto-retried**.

Only safe retries are allowed for non-order operations such as:

- transient network failures
- selected `5xx` responses
- auth refresh on `401` when a token provider is configured

---

## Environment Support

| Feature | Node | Browser |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Indicators, analytics, position sizing | ✅ | ✅ pure functions, no credentials |
| `PositionMonitor` exit signals | ✅ | ✅ feed it ticks from your own socket |
| REST API | ✅ | ❌ needs a token, and `api.dhan.co` sends no CORS headers |
| WebSocket Feed | ✅ | ❌ needs a token |
| Order Placement | ✅ | ❌ |
| Agent tools / MCP server | ✅ | ❌ Node-only |

The browser blockers are independent: a Dhan access token is a bearer
credential for a live trading account and must never ship to a client, **and**
the REST API sends no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, so the browser blocks the
response regardless. Run the SDK on a server and expose a narrow read-only API
to your frontend — see [`docs/BROWSER.md`](docs/BROWSER.md) for the pattern.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run typecheck
npm test -- --runInBand
```

Releasing is documented in [`docs/RELEASING.md`](docs/RELEASING.md).

### Smoke Test

```bash
npm run smoke
```

Relies on `.env` carrying `DHAN_TOKEN` and `DHAN_CLIENT_ID`.

## Generate API Client

```bash
npm run generate
```

This uses `openapi.json` to regenerate the typed API layer under `src/generated`.

## Safety Notes (READ THIS)

- Do not expose API tokens in frontend code
- Do not retry order placement automatically
- Always validate trading inputs before transport
- Use WebSocket for exit logic and execution-time state
- Prefer `correlationId` on every strategy-originated order

---

## Authentication

Five ways to supply a token, covered in full in
[`docs/AUTHENTICATION.md`](docs/AUTHENTICATION.md):

```ts
// 1. Static token
new DhanClient({ clientId, token });

// 2. Provider callback, re-resolved on every request
new DhanClient({ clientId, tokenProvider: () => vault.read("dhan/token") });

// 3. Automatic: generate from PIN + TOTP, renew before expiry
client.auth.enableAutoTokenManagement({ clientId, pin, totpSecret });

// 4. From DHAN_CLIENT_ID / DHAN_ACCESS_TOKEN, failing fast if unset
DhanClient.fromEnv();

// 5. From a token endpoint of your own
await DhanClient.fromTokenEndpoint({ endpointBaseUrl, bearerToken });
```

Plus TOTP generation, direct `generateAccessToken` / `renewWebToken`, and
`SELF` / `PARTNER` auth for the order-update WebSocket.

Two behaviours worth knowing:

- **Concurrent callers share one login.** Generating a token can invalidate
  the previous one, so parallel logins risk leaving the SDK holding a token
  the broker already replaced.
- **Offset-less expiry timestamps are read as IST.** JavaScript parses them as
  *local* time, which on a UTC server reads an IST expiry 5.5 hours late — the
  token would look valid well after the API began rejecting it.

Auth failures raise `AuthenticationError` carrying the broker's own message
("Invalid PIN" and "TOTP expired" need different fixes, and the status code
does not distinguish them).

See `docs/` and `AGENTS.md` for repo-level architecture and trading constraints.
