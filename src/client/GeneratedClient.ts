/**
 * Raw access to the OpenAPI-codegen services (`client.generated.*`) for
 * endpoints not yet wrapped by a hand-written resource class.
 *
 * Unlike every `client.<resource>` call, these bypass {@link HttpClient} —
 * and with it the tiered {@link RateLimiter} — entirely. Each generated
 * service method calls the codegen's own `request()` against the default
 * `axios` export directly, with no interceptor hook and no way to pass a
 * custom axios instance without editing files under `src/generated` (which
 * `npm run generate` overwrites). Patching the global `axios` singleton from
 * here was considered and rejected: it would throttle any other code in the
 * host process that happens to import the raw `axios` package, which is
 * exactly the kind of surprising action-at-a-distance a library must not do.
 *
 * Prefer the wrapped resource classes (`client.optionChain`, `client.orders`,
 * etc.) for anything rate-sensitive. If you call `client.generated.*`
 * directly — especially the option-chain or order endpoints — you are
 * responsible for spacing your own calls to Dhan's documented limits.
